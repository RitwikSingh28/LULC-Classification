# LULC Classification with Deep Learning

This project focuses on Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification using a shallow CNN. The main objective was to integrate domain knowledge of Remote Sensing to simplify the model architecture and reduce the training duration without significantly compromising the results.

## Project Overview

The LULC classification was performed on the Indian Pines dataset, a widely-used hyperspectral dataset in the remote sensing community. By incorporating domain-specific insights, we were able to streamline the model, achieving high accuracy while minimizing the training time.

### Key Achievements

- **Training Accuracy:** 97.95%
- **Testing Accuracy:** 97.45%

These results were achieved by carefully designing the model architecture and selecting features that leverage remote sensing knowledge.
